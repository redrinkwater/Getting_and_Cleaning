#run_analysis.R Codebook
==================================================================

Data were loaded from the following file: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

This contains information on the raw data and how it has been transformed by the researchers (features_info.txt).

run_analysis.R takes these original files and produces a new dataframe run_analysis.txt, the variables in this codebook refer to this output file.

Subject - an integer indicating the individual who performed the series if tests
Activity.Name - Laying, Stitting, Standing, Walking, Walking_Downstairs, Walking_Upstairs refers to the 6 different activities the subject was asked to perform. These descriptive names were translated from the numerical codes 1-6 provided in the raw data (ytrain.txt and ytest.txt)

The mean of the values for each variable for mean and standard deviation taken from the raw data (XTrain and XTest):
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
